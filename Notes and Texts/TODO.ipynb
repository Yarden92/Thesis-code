    "* check out debug_single_with_split and explore why after split the signal looks so bad\n",

    "* based on the T -> calc the max XI boundaries\n",
    "* find the xi boundaries by plotting and check if data wasn't trimmed\n",
    "* find the time boundaries by plotting and check if data wasn't trimmed\n",
    "* skip the bounce state to make it run faster\n",
    "* TODO: 3) compare with IFFT - on small factors they should be similar (on abs) up to time scale (pi)\n",
    "* missing upsampling\n",
    "* do linear IFFT and check the width of the signal in time (< but there is no units on t axis..)\n",
    "* pad x3i with zeros before and after\n",
    "* send stas and bella the scholarship documents\n",
    "* make the vectors more generic so we won't need to make sure that: `len(X_xi)+len(pulse_shaper)=2048`\n",
    "* validate that the pulse shape is fine\n",
    "* de-pulse shaping / sampling: how to convert from pulse back to (i,q) modulation symbols?\n",
    "* the BW is made up empirically, is there a formula way to calculate it?\n",
    "* match filter as depulse shaping / demodulation for rrc\n",
    "* add BER at the end\n",
    "* perhaps loop the BW thing further up with BER as result function\n",
    "* make a graph of BER as function of normalizing factor\n",
    "* make the number of symbols: 500 - 1000 check that the ber improves (power of two)\n",
    "* add channel - *split step fourier algorithm* (algorithm is at agrawal 2.4.1 [2.3.46 equation without alpha] paper)\n",
    "  *it includes the noise (at first we can neglect it)\n",
    "* work with units of: pico second and km\n",
    "* set params for split step:\n",
    "    * check on symbols: [64 :power of 2 :512]\n",
    "    * alpha = 0\n",

    "# what I've done so far:\n",
    "* I've found an interesting example for the pulse shaping, I adopted some of it to get better shape of the pulse\n",
    "* added an upsampling (zero padding between each sample)\n",
    "* important discovery: D length (time domain length) must be a power of 2!\n",
    "  * I updated the N_time fetching method accordingly\n",
    "* empirically discovery: BW should be about 700&bullet;2&pi; for the signal after NFT to look like before INFT\n",
